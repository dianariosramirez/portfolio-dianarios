            "p1": "When I decided to learn how to program, I had no idea where to start. As a food engineer, I was used to working with formulas and molecular structures, but I had never written a single line of code in my life. However, I knew I wanted to learn and was willing to do everything possible to achieve it.",
            "subtitle1": "How to start?",
            "p2": "The first thing I did was to search for online resources. I found many free tutorials and courses, and started reading and watching videos to understand the basics of programming. I learned about variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and much more. At first, everything seemed overwhelming, but gradually I began to understand how the different parts of a program connected together.",
            "p3": "After several days of self-learning, I realized that I needed more structure in my learning process. So, I enrolled in an online course on web programming and started following it step by step. The course helped me to better understand how programming concepts were applied to building websites.",
            "subtitle2": "Throughout time",
            "p4": "With time, I started building small projects on my own. I began with simple projects like a shopping list or a basic calculator. But as my confidence grew, I started working on more complex projects. One project that was especially rewarding for me was creating a web application for face detection in images using tools like React that allowed me to build web applications more easily.",
            "p5": "In summary, learning to program has been an exciting and challenging journey for me. At first, it seemed like a difficult path to take, but gradually I began to understand the concepts and apply what I learned. As I gained experience, I felt more confident and capable of building new things. If you're also starting out in the world of programming, my advice is to take your time to understand the basics, find a learning structure that suits your style, and practice as much as you can.",

It is a framework by which people can tackle complex adaptive problems while delivering the highest possible value products productively and creatively.

We say that they are current concepts because previously everything was done with PHP, incredible, right?

            "p3": "Modern web development arises around 2008 when the HTML5 boom begins, it is at this moment where we start talking about Frontend and Backend, because web technology grows enormously thanks to the APIs that came with HTML5, these APIs make it possible a communication between Backend and Frontend, in this way any Frontend can communicate with any Backend.",
            "subtitle2": "Frontend",
            "p4": "The frontend, as we already said, is the client and it is the one that is in charge of all the logic of this when you want to make a request, we can say that this concept arose in 2008 due to the tools that emerged from that moment: HTML5, CSS3 (2008), JSON (2013 - 2015), AngularJS (2010), Ember, Backbone, Rest (2000) and Nodejs, these technologies made the Frontend possible.",
            "p5": "The Frontend has been evolving with new technologies such as: ES6 (2015), React (2013), Vue (2014), Angular (2016), GraphQL (2015), which at least you must have already heard; in the Today's landscape comes into play WebAssembly which is a new type of code that runs in modern web browsers and provides new features and huge performance gains.",
